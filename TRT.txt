Pacific Northwest Search and Rescue, Inc
Trail Running Team Membership, Deployment, & Equipment Guidelines Effective: April 2017

This document covers requirements and guidelines regarding membership, deployment, and equipment as applicable to a trail running team as a function of PNWSAR search and rescue ground operations.
The trail running team (TRT) will be used on an as-needed basis to supplement the core competencies of PNWSAR when rapid coverage of trail systems is needed.
The utilization of running teams allows large distances of trails and roads to be covered quickly that vehicles or mountain bikes cannot easily access. This team can also be utilized to reach a subject(s) quickly to begin care and formulate an extraction plan.

Membership Guidelines & Responsibilities:
1. Eligibility: TRT membership will be available to any PNWSAR team member in good standing that has been active for at least six months. TRT membership will be evaluated on an ongoing basis by meeting the equipment and fitness criteria below.
2. Equipment: Basic equipment as defined below must be obtained, maintained in good working order, and carried in order to be deployed.
3. Fitness: All TRT members must be able to run 10 miles on a trail wearing a pack that contains the minimum required equipment outlined below. Team members must demonstrate this annually. It is recommended that all TRT members complete a 10 mile team run with a pack bi-monthly, or have a race result of at least 10 miles in place of the bi-monthly team run.
Deployment Guidelines:
1. Due to the fact that a trail running team carries minimal equipment for maximum movement efficiency divided amongst team members, deployed team members must remain together at all times in the field.
2. Eye protection will be carried by all members. Helmets may be required at the discretion of the PIC. If helmets are not worn or carried into the field, this may impact individuals’ ability to participate in rescue operation where normally helmets would be required. Determination will be made by the TL on a case by case basis.
